LongestString to measure the longest string out of a bunch.

LongestString comes in quite handy when you want to do formatting with
monospaced fonts such as the output of a CLI application. You'll need it, trust
me on this one.
LongestString uses mbstring to determine the string length, so you'll get the
character length according to the encoding used for a string and not its length
as a binary string.
